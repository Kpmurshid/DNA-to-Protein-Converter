# DNA to Protein Converter

This repository contains a Python script that converts DNA sequences into corresponding protein sequences based on the codon table. It is implemented without using external libraries like Biopython.

## Features
- Converts DNA sequence to amino acids using a codon table.
- Handles stop codons (`*`) and unknown codons (`X`).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-Kpmurshid/DNA-to-Protein-Converter.git
